# yt-Timestamp
A Chrome extension to bookmark/timestamp a video

This repository contains the files for a Chrome extension that modifies the YouTube interface and adds a button on the bottom left corner to bookmark the current time of the video you are watching.
It stores this information in the Chrome API storage and displays it when the Chrome extension button is clicked.
This information is stored in the Chrome API for as long as the extension is installed, so it won't delete when you exit the video or tab.
Each timestamp has a button that will jump to the bookmarked time. It also has a button that will let you delete the timestamp, and eventually, there will be a button to name each timestamp.
